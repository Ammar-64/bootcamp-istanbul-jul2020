Please pull request the pseudocode that you worked on with the first class. You
worked in pairs, **each person** must pull request (so each pseudocode will have
two copies).

Please make the file have your name in it, for example, the pull request should
be in the pseudocode directory with exactly one file: `louis-li.md`.
